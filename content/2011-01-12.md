### Resolution to Endorse the Reduction of Diesel Emissions from Construction Equipment to be Used in Building the Center of Excellence in Nano Mechanical Science and Engineering

Sponsor: Daniel P. McCarter

**Passed: January 12, 2011**

WHEREAS, the University of Michigan Engineering Council (UMEC) and its member society co-curricular organizations in the College of Engineering act as a liaison between the student body and the administration,

WHEREAS, UMEC and its member societies represent a diverse association of student organizations and opinions from throughout the College of Engineering,

WHEREAS, University is planning to build a new 3-story lab facility adjacent to the G.G. Brown Building as soon as Fall 2011 or Winter 2012,

WHEREAS, a construction project of this scale will require significant use of diesel-powered equipment for an extended period of time,

WHEREAS, fumes from diesel-powered equipment release significant amounts of particulate matter and other pollutants dangerous to human health,

WHEREAS, thousands of students, staff, and faculty who study and work on North Campus will be exposed to air pollution from the construction site on an almost daily basis,

WHEREAS, the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel used in conjunction with certain after-treatment technologies can reduce particulate pollution from construction equipment by 90%,

WHEREAS, public and private entities across the country have successfully implemented these cost-effective technologies to the well-being of their communities,

LET IT BE RESOLVED, that UMEC endorses the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel in conjunction with after-treatment technologies to remove the majority of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from construction equipment used in building the Center of Excellence in Nano Mechanical Science and Engineering.

LET IT BE RESOLVED, that UMEC urges the University to require companies awarded with construction contracts to implement these measures.

LET IT BE RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be submitted to David Munson, Dean of Engineering, Jack Hu, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, James Holloway, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education, Henry Baier, Associate Vice President for Facilities and Operations, Terry Alexander, Executive Director of  the Office of Campus Sustainability, Don Scavia, Special Counsel to the U-M President for Sustainability, and Marina Roelofs, Executive Director of Architecture, Engineering and Construction.
